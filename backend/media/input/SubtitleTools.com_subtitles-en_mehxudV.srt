00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,480
In this video, we will continue with the overview of scrum,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,430
and discuss roles and events.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,020
We will start by discussing scrum roles.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,985
A scrum team is made up of three roles: product owner,

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,380
scrum master, and development team.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,250
The scrum team is made up of cross-functional

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,680
team members allowing it to complete stories within the team.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,100
It is flexible and adaptable with members willing to

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,425
help out where needed and continuously learning new things.

10
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,570
It is self-organizing.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,670
The team is responsible for deciding how to organize and do it's work.

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,870
Stakeholders are not members of the scrum team,

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,475
but are interested in the success of the project.

14
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:58,730
There are internal stakeholders such as company managers,

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,555
executives or other scrum teams that rely on the work of the scrum team.

16
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,370
There are also stakeholders that are external to

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,000
the organization such as customers, partners, and investors.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,860
The product owner is the member of the scrum team

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,115
who is responsible for communicating the product vision.

20
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:22,045
The stakeholders and the scrum team need to have

21
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:25,825
an understanding of the product vision in order to work effectively.

22
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:31,170
The product owner is also responsible for maximizing the value of each increment.

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,730
Each feature that the development team works on should be of high value.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,690
The product owner is responsible for the product backlog.

25
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,080
Others may help with the product backlog,

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,315
but the product owner is responsible for it.

27
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:49,570
Stakeholders primarily interact with the product owner.

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,660
The product owner represents the stakeholders when they are not

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,305
part of the discussion such as during scrum team meetings.

30
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:01,720
The product owner is accountable to the stakeholders for the success of the project.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,880
The scrum master is the member of the scrum team who is

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,335
primarily responsible for promoting and supporting scrum,

33
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:13,450
for scrum team members as well as stakeholders.

34
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,510
It is up to the scrum master to ensure that everyone

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,385
understands how and why things are done a certain way.

36
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:26,405
The scrum master is also responsible for the day-to-day effectiveness of the scrum team.

37
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:32,290
This includes ensuring that the team is reaching it's goals and continuously improving.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,290
The scrum master is responsible for protecting the focus of the team.

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,630
This may mean helping to remove bottlenecks or ensuring that

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,630
those outside are interacting with the team in helpful ways.

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,480
In general, scrum masters do what they need to

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,240
do to allow team members to focus on their work.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,760
The scrum master is also responsible for increasing the transparency of the project.

44
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,385
There should be no surprises about the current status of the project.

45
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:08,460
The scrum master's tasks vary by project and from day-to-day.

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,625
Typical tasks include coaching the scrum team and stakeholders on scrum and agile,

47
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,695
helping to remove blocking issues,

48
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:25,600
facilitating scrum events, configuring scrum artifacts,

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,290
and monitoring sprint progress.

50
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,175
This distinction of the product owner and scrum master roles should now be pretty clear.

51
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,835
The product owner is responsible for the value of the product.

52
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:43,660
The scrum master is primarily responsible for the effectiveness of the team.

53
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,810
You can think of this both as a divide and conquer

54
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,080
approach because the work of the roles is so different.

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,890
Also, as a checks and balances approach because combining

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,690
the roles could put too much weight on one of the responsibilities.

57
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,780
The separate roles lead to greater team success and sustainability.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,885
The development team is a cross-functional,

59
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:10,210
adaptive team that does the work of the project.

60
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,770
Responsibilities of the development team include:

61
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,870
estimating issues- this is usually done using story points,

62
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,715
but other estimation methods can be used;

63
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:23,420
deciding on how much work can be done in

64
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,615
the sprint- only the development team can decide how much work to take out.

65
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,130
It is assumed that the development team is in

66
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,045
the best position to forecast how much work the issues take.

67
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:38,760
Deciding how to organize to do the work of the team-

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,345
this is because the team is an empowered, self-organizing team;

69
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:48,280
creating the increment of each sprint; and finally,

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,810
the development team are the only members allowed

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,995
to modify the sprint backlog during the sprint.

72
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:59,850
This is sometimes necessary as the team learns and adjusts as it is building.

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,085
The Scrum Guide recommends having from three to nine members of the development team.

74
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,380
Fewer than three members decreases the productivity and

75
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,515
quality created by a cross-functional group of people working together.

76
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:18,415
More than nine members tends to increase the amount of coordination required.

77
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:22,480
Jeff Bezos at Amazon refers to two pizza teams,

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,865
meaning two pizzas should be able to feed the entire team.

79
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:28,285
To scale scrum to more than nine people,

80
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:31,760
it is usually better to create multiple teams.

81
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,630
Next, we will discuss scrum events.

82
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,895
A sprint contains four types of events.

83
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:45,680
You may also hear events referred to as ceremonies or simply meetings.

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,350
The events are the sprint planning meeting,

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,345
the daily standups, the sprint review,

86
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,295
and the sprint retrospective.

87
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:58,550
Scrum events occur at regular intervals and minimize the need for other meetings.

88
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,520
These events are designed to maximize the opportunities for feedback,

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,435
and continuous learning, and are a key part of achieving agility.

90
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:11,140
In between these meetings is where the work of the issues of the sprint is completed.

91
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,610
We will discuss each of these meetings separately.

92
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,985
All of the scrum meetings have some common characteristics.

93
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:24,980
The meetings have a fixed maximum time limit and no minimum time limit.

94
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,150
Meetings can never go over their allotted time,

95
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,390
but they can be ended early if the purpose of the meeting is achieved.

96
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,995
The meetings are primarily to plan, inspect, and adapt.

97
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:40,510
In agile projects, the planning is distributed throughout

98
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,295
the project rather than the mostly upfront planning of waterfall projects.

99
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:49,310
These meetings are an important part of that distributed planning.

100
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,300
The meetings are used to inspect the project and

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,305
adapt with the team is doing based on that inspection.

102
00:06:55,305 --> 00:07:00,540
This is a key part of increasing transparency and continuous improvement.

103
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,485
The meetings are primarily about the team collaborating,

104
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,705
not about updating status.

105
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,280
The work is visualized,

106
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,590
so you don't need a meeting to see the status.

107
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,795
It is the responsibility of every team member to ensure that meetings have

108
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:21,150
value and to help modify them to increase their value if necessary.

109
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,530
If the discussion moves in a direction that

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,940
becomes a value to only a portion of the participants,

111
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,040
it should be moved to a later time outside of the meeting.

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,670
The sprint planning meeting is held at the start of a sprint.

113
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,580
The entire scrum team attends the meeting.

114
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,165
The duration of the meeting is typically four hours for a two week sprint.

115
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,175
If your sprints are four weeks long,

116
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:52,130
you can expect this meeting to be twice as long.

117
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,670
The purpose of the meeting is to plan the work of the sprint.

118
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,510
The output of the meeting is an agreed upon sprint goal and a sprint backlog.

119
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,900
Before the meeting, the product owner usually has

120
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,625
a proposed sprint goal and a minimum set of issues that accomplish the goal.

121
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,510
These preliminary items often come from

122
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,150
the product backlog that has been updated during the previous sprints,

123
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,280
sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings.

124
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,750
We will discuss these meetings a bit later.

125
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,455
During the meeting, the team usually discusses the sprint goal,

126
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,590
modifies the sprint backlog,

127
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,350
places story point estimates on issues,

128
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,380
and adds details to the issues to better describe the specific work to be done.

129
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,450
The development team is responsible for estimating the story points for

130
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,620
the work and deciding on how much work can be done during the sprint.

131
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,050
They need to do enough planning to have

132
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,010
an accurate forecast for the amount of work that they will agree to.

133
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,305
The development team also creates subtasks for the first few days of the sprint.

134
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,710
The subtasks are often a day or less of work.

135
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,710
This is an example of an empowered team rather than a command and control based team.

136
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,690
The purpose of the meeting has been met when there is

137
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,865
an agreed upon sprint goal and sprint backlog.

138
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,720
The sprint backlog contains the issues that

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,810
the development team has agreed to complete during the sprint,

140
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,060
as well as a plan for completing that work.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,450
The daily standup meeting is also called the daily scrum.

142
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,805
It is a planning meeting that occurs everyday

143
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,060
and the participants usually stand as a reminder that it's a short meeting.

144
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,790
The meeting usually takes place in the same location at the same time everyday.

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,780
The development team are the primary attendees for the daily standup.

146
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,680
Others may attend the meetings,

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,730
but are usually asked to listen only.

148
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,750
The meeting usually last 15 minutes or less.

149
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,470
The purpose of the meeting is to inspect recent progress toward the sprint goal,

150
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,910
plan the day's work,

151
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,865
and identify any impediments to the team.

152
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:11,220
The team usually makes plans to resolve the impediments,

153
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,050
but the discussion often moves to after the meeting.

154
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,120
The output of the meeting is the plan for the day.

155
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,380
It's important that the daily standup is

156
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,680
a collaborative meeting and not simply a status update.

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,420
The team collaborates to make

158
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,725
the best decisions for the day given the latest information.

159
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:33,465
They usually decide on who will work on specific issues,

160
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,995
to plan slightly changes after every daily standup.

161
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,150
This is continuous improvement.

162
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,995
The link at the bottom is a link from the atlassian team playbook on standups.

163
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,960
You can find more information there.

164
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,755
The sprint review meeting occurs near the end of the sprint.

165
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:57,710
It is an informal meeting that includes the scrum team and interested stakeholders.

166
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,800
It is typically a two hour meeting for two week sprints.

167
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,220
The purpose of the meeting is to inspect the increment that was just

168
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,700
created in the sprint and to collaboratively update the product backlog.

169
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,290
This is a meeting with a lot of feedback on the project and

170
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,640
includes a brainstorming session to help decide what to do next.

171
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,515
The output of the meeting is a first-pass at the next sprint's backlog.

172
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:28,240
By the time the sprint planning meeting happens for the following sprint,

173
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,490
the team already has a good idea of what they will be working on.

174
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,785
The sprint retrospective is the last event of the sprint.

175
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:43,200
The scrum team attends the retrospective.

176
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,900
The meeting typically takes 90 minutes for a two week sprint.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,740
The purpose of the meeting is for the team to inspect itself including it's processes,

178
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,055
tools, and team interaction.

179
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,520
The retrospective is a positive meeting containing constructive feedback.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,030
Everyone should always remember that they are part of a team.

181
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,620
The scrum master usually helps make sure that this is a positive meeting.

182
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,280
The team usually discusses what they should keep doing,

183
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,990
what they should stop doing,

184
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,740
and what they should start doing.

185
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,905
The meeting is about continuously improving the team.

186
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,480
The output of the meeting is to add

187
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,680
one or more improvement related issues to the next sprint's backlog.

188
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,489
It's important that the team spent some of it's time on these issues,

189
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,730
rather than exclusively building the product.

190
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,250
The link at the bottom is from the atlassian team playbook on retrospectives.

191
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,120
You can find more information there.

192
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,000
Here's a summary of the four meetings related to a sprint.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's important to always make sure that the meetings have

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,490
high value and the team should focus on continuously improving their meetings.

195
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,155
Notice that the next sprint goal and sprint backlog start to form in the sprint review.

196
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:07,760
The retrospective usually adds one or more issues.

197
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,440
This forms the starting sprint backlog for the sprint planning meeting.

198
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,780
Here is a review of what we've discussed in this video.

199
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,500
Scrum roles include the product owner,

200
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,510
scrum master, development team members, and stakeholders.

201
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,895
Scrum meetings include the sprint planning meeting,

202
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,420
daily standups, the sprint review,

203
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,910
and the sprint retrospective.

204
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,250
Now, it's time to work on some of the topics

205
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,995
discussed in this video and in the previous video.

206
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:45,440
Separate hands on instructions are provided.
