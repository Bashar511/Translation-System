1
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,289
No.

2
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,571
No means no.

3
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:53,882
<i>Bonjour.</i>

4
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,485
<i>Carl, I know it's you.</i>

5
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,349
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:00,024
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,490
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send. "

8
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,855
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:07,362
<i>Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.</i>

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,090
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

11
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,533
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,172
<i>- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?</i>

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,773
<i>We're all going out tonight.</i>

14
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:19,536
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,735
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,778
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,210
<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

18
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:27,546
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,449
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:31,850
<i>Thing? What thing?</i>

21
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,514
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:36,627
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,025
<i>...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.</i>

24
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:42,291
<i>I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.</i>

25
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,059
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:47,330
<i>Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store"?</i>

27
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,633
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,299
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:55,913
<i>I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.</i>

30
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,880
<i>- That's not me.
- It's not?</i>

31
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,749
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,981
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,750
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:08,950
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:12,062
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,756
<i>Carl, I know you're not saying anything.</i>

37
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:19,200
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,033
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,936
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,571
Hi.

41
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,944
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:36,554
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:39,520
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,625
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:45,388
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,122
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,767
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,369
...because we have an announcement
to make.

49
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:54,437
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,169
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,639
We're engaged.

52
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,210
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,941
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,982
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,517
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,518
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,157
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:17,928
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

59
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,155
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,357
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:25,770
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,531
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,300
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,535
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,772
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,877
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:44,853
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,721
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,989
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,463
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,829
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,631
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,831
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,373
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:05,805
Hey.

76
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:08,070
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,238
<i>- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.</i>

78
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:14,013
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,711
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,480
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:22,218
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:25,420
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:28,498
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,330
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:37,273
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,000
Whoa!

87
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,682
See you, guys.

88
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,404
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:14,909
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,207
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:20,283
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,044
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,485
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,921
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,518
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,255
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,764
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:38,899
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:44,034
Persianwifefinder. com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:48,273
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,239
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,313
Here we go.

103
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:59,423
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,692
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,586
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,133
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,361
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:14,494
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:20,334
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,843
Okay.

111
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:26,208
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:27,783
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,046
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

114
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,747
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,825
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,395
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:42,658
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,632
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:49,402
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,474
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:56,376
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:59,608
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,720
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,313
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,882
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,220
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,763
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:15,559
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,794
...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,005
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,108
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,336
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,946
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:35,018
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,346
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,046
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,250
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,934
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,940
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,079
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,377
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

142
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,576
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:12,245
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:13,823
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,653
God.

146
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,786
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:22,126
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,827
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,562
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,731
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,140
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:36,272
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,414
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,313
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,249
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine. "

156
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,082
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:49,750
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,756
No, you don't.

159
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,621
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,927
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,095
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,866
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,007
Oh, my God.

164
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,373
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:10,872
<i>Stay right there.</i>

166
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,880
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:21,385
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,426
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,737
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:38,366
Sorry.

171
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>- Hello?
- Stephanie?</i>

172
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,545
<i>- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

173
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,846
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,777
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:54,152
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,350
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:11,264
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:21,378
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:33,063
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:37,600
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,134
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:43,939
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,906
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,645
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:54,046
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,779
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:59,822
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,357
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,554
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:09,723
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,301
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,634
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,335
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

194
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,946
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down. "

195
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,309
I mean, do you even know
my fiancee's last name?

196
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:28,452
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,852
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:36,255
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,917
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,458
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:43,328
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:46,996
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,036
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

204
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:52,301
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:55,810
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

206
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,350
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,885
Hey, Carl.

208
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,664
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:21,004
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,735
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:28,709
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,418
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,348
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,682
He never did much.

215
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,187
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,825
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:46,987
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:48,996
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,806
What was that?

220
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,785
<i>Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.</i>

221
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,649
<i>Please, find a seat.</i>

222
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,151
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,852
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,123
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,497
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,829
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,837
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

228
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,034
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,679
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,041
That's why you're here.

231
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:15,083
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,081
It's starting.

233
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,613
<i>Life.</i>

234
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,518
<i>We are all living it. Or are we?</i>

235
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,060
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:31,634
<i>Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?</i>

237
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,930
<i>From the external.</i>

238
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:38,166
<i>And how do we control the external?
With one word.</i>

239
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,274
<i>And what is that word?</i>

240
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,838
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,009
Yes.

242
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:48,676
Yes.

243
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,388
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,991
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,497
The word is "yes. "

246
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:07,535
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,967
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,835
Say it a million more times.

249
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,308
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,607
Yes!

251
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,647
Yes.

252
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:30,826
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:35,830
...because it will RSVP "yes. "

254
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:41,896
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:48,501
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:55,452
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:02,792
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,087
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:11,532
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:19,101
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,909
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,750
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,317
Thank you.

264
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,551
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,491
<i>- No.
- No man. No man.</i>

266
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,723
<i>No man. No man. No man.</i>

267
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,093
<i>No man. No man.</i>

268
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:44,666
Okay.

269
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:49,339
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:53,732
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:02,944
What's your name?

272
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,188
Carl.

273
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:07,989
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,821
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,420
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,330
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:19,960
No.

278
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:24,198
<i>No man. No man.
No man. No man.</i>

279
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,002
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:30,110
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:33,278
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,816
...and to yourself.

283
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,880
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:43,288
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,326
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,488
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:56,302
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:56,474 --> 00:18:00,638
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,772
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,646
I have had some trouble.

291
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:21,687
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,324
<i>- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...</i>

293
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,295
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,700
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:30,898
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,565
Yes!

297
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,604
Once you leave this building...

298
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,772
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,748
...no matter what it is...

300
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,979
...you will say yes.

301
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,248
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,721
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,985
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,192
What if I...

305
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,093
say

306
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,058
...the other word?

307
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,804
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:06,000
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:09,476
...things can get a little dicey.

310
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,207
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,847
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,781
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,252
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,550
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,159
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,158
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:30,932
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:35,797
Yes!

319
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,526
Hey, there he is.

320
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,466
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,003
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,471
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:15,100
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,477
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:24,849
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,386
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,123
<i>Oh. Ugh...</i>

328
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:32,660
Yes!

329
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:37,092
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,670
Yeah, why not?

331
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:46,202
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,245
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:28,745
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,114
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,883
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,788
Go ahead.

337
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,619
And what did you say?

338
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:46,196
Oh, I'm just right
over here. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:48,032
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,908
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,737
Oh, great.

342
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:58,938
<i>- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.</i>

343
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:02,574
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,419
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,257
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:12,061
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:15,455
Okay.

348
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,659
I've come this far.

349
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,265
Yes, you can.

350
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:25,169
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:34,316
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,688
God bless you, man.

353
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,545
Oh, come on.

354
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:05,512
Come on, come on.

355
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:11,182
Perfect.

356
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:15,723
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give
all your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,383
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:19,085
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,527
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,190
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,199
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,738
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,889
Come on, man.

364
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:55,854
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:15,842
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,114
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,014
That's a good look.

368
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:27,454
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,760
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:32,532
Maybe.

371
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:38,197
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,206
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:44,143
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:47,113
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:49,684
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:52,885
He used up your phone?

377
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:56,993
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,755
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,922
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,728
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,394
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,768
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,400
On that thing?

384
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:26,282
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:29,324
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,257
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

387
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:35,159
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:49,342
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:55,277
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:11,759
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,236
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:19,638
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,802
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,472
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:32,219
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:33,549
Yeah.

397
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:36,889
Thanks.

398
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,188
So you okay?

399
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:42,560
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:45,258
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,497
Hey, I...

402
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:57,838
Have a good night.

403
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,040
Yes.

404
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,918
"Yes always leads
to something good.

405
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:42,152
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,419
They may come in any form. "

407
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:52,163
<i>- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.</i>

408
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,271
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

409
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,168
I guess.

410
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:01,309
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:28:01,478 --> 00:28:03,139
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:05,375
Sure.

413
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,007
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:13,418
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,520
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,758
Right.

417
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,995
Like I need that.

418
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:35,243
<i>- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.</i>

419
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,903
<i>Would you be the man for me?</i>

420
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,111
I guess so.

421
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:44,483
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:45,952
And what's your business?

423
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:49,354
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,719
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,789
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,333
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,035
So, what do you think?

428
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,933
I think yes.

429
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,740
Inta-maresting.

430
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,684
Cakes, huh?

431
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:19,948
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,788
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,487
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:31,498
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,567
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:35,932
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,971
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:39,165
What?

439
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:43,905
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,676
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,285
...whichever, or I walk. "

442
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,718
Really? What did they say?

443
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,620
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:59,125
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:02,754
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,557
And?

447
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,099
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,032
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:09,934
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,972
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,440
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:16,806
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,004
He's not here.

454
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:20,547
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:23,709
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:27,386
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:31,584
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:34,595
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,632
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:40,560
See what I did there?

461
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:46,039
I joined "bro" with "Joseph. " Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,033
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:55,107
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,918
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,886
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:05,720
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,421
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:12,364
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:16,563
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,709
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,140
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,177
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:27,316
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,615
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,155
Okay.

476
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:43,496
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,864
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:52,365
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,312
Argh!

480
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,484
Okay, okay.

481
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,899
He did it.

482
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,215
Drinks on me.

483
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,280
Crazy, man.

484
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,053
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:42,691
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

486
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,690
Absolutely.

487
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:49,059
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,003
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,696
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:59,535
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:04,908
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:08,244
I made a sacred "conevant. "

493
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,379
That sounded naughty.

494
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,819
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,323
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

496
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,321
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:24,365
...I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

498
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:26,866
...because she deserves that.

499
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:30,495
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,232
That is so nice.

501
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,138
Oh, shit.

502
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:44,881
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,683
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:49,553
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:52,456
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

506
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,563
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:58,292
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:00,732
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:04,271
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:06,500
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,769
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:13,379
<i>Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?</i>

513
00:34:13,783 --> 00:34:16,183
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:20,119
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,884
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:27,194
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

517
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:31,232
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:32,425
What?

519
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:37,403
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

520
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:40,941
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:48,215
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,146
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,845
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:56,584
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,159
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:02,290
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,590
You're a complete...

528
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:06,893
You all right?

529
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,163
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,068
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,232
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,275
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:20,845
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:27,687
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,328
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:36,294
No. No, she's not.

537
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:12,025
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:13,601
What can I do for you?

539
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,103
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,700
Oh, really?

541
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:32,047
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:35,623
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,357
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,362
What are you doing?

545
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:46,168
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,896
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:52,132
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:36:52,308 --> 00:36:55,106
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:59,374
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,108
You are so handsome.

551
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,817
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:13,657
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

553
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,492
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,499
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:21,033
<i>Uh...</i>

556
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:26,271
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:30,106
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,647
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:36,877
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:40,318
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:45,450
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

562
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:49,756
In my nightmares.

563
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,398
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:57,601
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:37:57,774 --> 00:38:02,507
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

566
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:17,617
Nice dog.

567
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:33,674
Just relax. I'll handle this.

568
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:40,940
Oh, God!

569
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:45,714
<i>Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...</i>

570
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:47,615
Wow.

571
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:50,154
<i>That... Oh...</i>

572
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:53,161
<i>That is a...</i>

573
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:55,126
How are you doing that? Ay!

<i>"Costume party. Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character. "</i>

575
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:06,566
You got it, Norm.

576
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:55,615
Hi.

577
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:01,286
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:04,331
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a. m. and 5:30?

579
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,636
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:10,671
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

581
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:15,038
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

582
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,544
Yeah. All right.

583
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:25,181
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

584
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:33,162
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

585
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:36,890
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

586
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,727
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

587
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:45,898
<i>I would understand</i>

588
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:49,567
All right, now I got it.

589
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:54,811
Whoa.

590
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,559
What did he call me?

591
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:17,196
Homeless.

592
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,205
Come and get it.

593
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,378
There you are. You want some?

594
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:23,909
He never listens.

595
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Yeah.

596
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,383
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

597
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:35,582
Next.

598
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,227
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

599
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:42,091
Way to stick in there.

600
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,748
There you go.

601
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:05,351
Hey. I came.

602
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:07,617
Great.

603
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:10,253
Yeah.

604
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,756
Rolling Rock, please.

605
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,499
- From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.

606
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:22,965
There was a band.

607
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:25,164
Oh, yes, there was.

608
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:27,207
And we were that band.

609
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,174
Yes, we were.

610
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,108
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

611
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,838
Oh, yes, they did.

612
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:38,109
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

613
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:39,720
Yeah.

614
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,949
And that band was rad.

615
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:50,989
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

616
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,067
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

627
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:31,562
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:36,110
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,179
Happy networking, asshole.

00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:54,917
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:58,492
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:01,425
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,565
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:06,293
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,438
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:15,470
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:19,012
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:22,014
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:23,481
You want a drink?

651
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,849
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

<i>- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?</i>

653
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:35,021
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,832
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:43,404
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:45,973
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:50,135
It's in Griffith Park
and we do a loop. It's about five miles.

658
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,611
It's at 6 a. m.

659
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:57,048
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a. m.
In, like, never.

660
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:01,349
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:46:02,725 --> 00:46:04,158
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:07,421
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,723
Whatever I want.

664
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:13,266
I volunteer at a shelter. I paint a little bit.

665
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,870
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:18,302
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667

<i>Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...</i>

668
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:28,448
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:30,711
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:33,081
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,654
You said that.

672
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:37,452
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:42,354
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:46,592
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:47,963
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:53,440
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...</i>

677
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:56,874
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:14,720
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,626
<i>Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.</i>

680
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:20,360
<i>Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?</i>

681
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,094
Yeah.

682
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,113
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,543
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,581
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:37,582
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:49,259
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:52,230
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:56,462
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,699
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:03,811
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,605
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,444
Allison.

693
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,812
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:17,288
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,361
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:22,827
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:26,729
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:28,767
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:31,304
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:34,910
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:37,807
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,972
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,550
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,311
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:46,614
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:48,016
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,488
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,752
Red Bull.

709
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:57,993
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,567
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,931
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:13,506
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:16,607
Hold that.

714
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:19,079
Got it.

715
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,257
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:35,994
Hold it right there.

717
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,810
That's good.

718
00:49:54,056 --> 00:49:59,050
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,362
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,656
You know, listen.

721
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:06,268
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

722
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:08,767
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:10,803
I love that.

724
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:14,170
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

725
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:16,402
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:20,015
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:50:20,182 --> 00:50:22,844
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:26,681
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:30,587
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life. "

730
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:32,488
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:36,422
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

732
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,864
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

733
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:43,436
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

734
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:45,865
Might be.

735
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:49,744
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:53,177
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,341
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:50:56,518 --> 00:51:00,147
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:01,687
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:06,255
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:09,789
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:11,057
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,565
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:18,269
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,986
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:34,622
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,280
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,756
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

749
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:40,896
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,263
How did you two meet again?

751
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:47,095
Persianwifefinder. Com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:49,669
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,238
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:55,275
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:59,278
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:00,847
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,250
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:07,582
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:10,156
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:13,420
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:52:13,595 --> 00:52:17,122
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:22,500
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:28,605
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:32,510
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:35,844
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:38,384
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,622
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,892
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,290
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,021
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:57,106 --> 00:53:00,132
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:04,570
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,879
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,040
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:12,082
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

777
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:13,516
Costumes for what?

778
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:17,618
<i>Expelliarmus! Just kidding.</i>

779
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,886
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:53:20,062 --> 00:53:23,862
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,593
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:30,034
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:53:31,073 --> 00:53:32,301
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:36,638
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:40,641
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:42,443
...chips, dips...

787
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:45,951
...and good people, just like you two.

788
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:48,086
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:53:48,257 --> 00:53:49,986
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:53:55,697 --> 00:53:58,393
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:01,092
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

792
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:05,434
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

793
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:08,576
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:12,339
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

795
00:54:12,714 --> 00:54:14,875
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,013
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:22,382
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:27,028
<i>Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?</i>

799
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,889
"I'm not going home, not really. "

800
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:35,532
<i>Oh, bye.</i>

801
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:43,500
<i>Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?</i>

802
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:55,181
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:57,882
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

804
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,291
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

805
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:05,263
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:08,767
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:55:08,937 --> 00:55:10,734
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:14,000
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:16,235
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:55:24,686 --> 00:55:25,948
Hey.

811
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:28,516
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:38,197
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:41,833
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,907
I got an idea.

815
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:59,884
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:07,327
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:15,135
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:43,689
This is unreal.

819
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:46,059
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:56:56,278 --> 00:56:57,609
<i>Ooh</i>

821
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:01,405
<i>Ooh</i>

822
00:57:07,155 --> 00:57:08,452
<i>Ooh</i>

823
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:27,739
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:32,074
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:58,564
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,937
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:05,239
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:06,608
I killed her.

829
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,378
I'm a somebody.

830
00:58:10,585 --> 00:58:12,780
I don't know about that.

831
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:15,548
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:18,921
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:21,824
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:26,991
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:31,333
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

836
00:58:31,506 --> 00:58:36,375
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

837
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:39,480
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

838
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:41,479
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:43,450
It's like my photography.

840
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:46,086
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

841
00:58:46,254 --> 00:58:47,846
<i>...taken while running, but...</i>

842
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:50,150
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:53,852
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:55,621
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:58,425
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:01,168
I love your music.

847
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:04,269
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

848
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,835
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,671
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:13,144
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,714
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:16,646
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:21,255
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:59:24,426 --> 00:59:25,654
Run!

855
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:27,622
Hello, everybody.

856
00:59:27,796 --> 00:59:33,234
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

857
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,563
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:59:39,975 --> 00:59:42,671
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:45,312
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:49,742
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:53,218
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:56,715
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:58,723
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:59:58,894 --> 01:00:02,853
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:06,194
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:09,599
Well, we had a nice run.

867
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:12,035
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:15,366
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

869
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:17,671
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:20,280
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:23,077
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,513
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:25,914
Yeah, you were.

874
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:29,614
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:32,954
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:36,097
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:38,095
You may be my last loan.

878
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,830
It's a Ducati.

879
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:45,495
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:50,334
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,976
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
01:00:57,752 --> 01:00:59,447
Carl.

883
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:05,020
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:07,093
Pleasure to meet you.

885
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:18,933
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

886
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:21,132
You have given out...

887
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,878
...561.

888
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:26,103
A little more than average, then.

889
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:28,647
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:36,056
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:38,158
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:41,318
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

893
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:43,623
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:46,266
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

895
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:49,460
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,268
But...

897
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:00,845
But then I looked closer.

898
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:04,312
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:07,614
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:09,882
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:14,324
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

902
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,755
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:20,493
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:22,932
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:25,264
That's great. I would have to say...

906
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,273
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:30,604
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:34,681
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,548
Got it. Yep.

910
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:39,687
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:42,379
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:47,051
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,633
This one is nice.

914
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:58,204
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,397
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:00,939
Yeah.

917
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:04,670
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:06,575
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:10,377
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

920
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:12,477
Yeah.

921
01:03:12,654 --> 01:03:14,554
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:03:14,723 --> 01:03:16,315
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:19,289
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,895
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:03:22,063 --> 01:03:25,658
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:33,030
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

927
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:22,947
Okay.

928
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:29,163
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,766
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:40,636
What's going on?

931
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:44,436
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:47,306
Jump.

933
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:50,407
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:54,980
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:04:55,156 --> 01:04:57,056
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,219
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

937
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:01,862
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,488
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:09,000
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:29,246
Don't do it.

941
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,259
It can't be that bad.

942
01:05:35,663 --> 01:05:37,062
Hey, buddy.

943
01:05:37,699 --> 01:05:39,189
Who are you, man?

944
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:43,064
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

945
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:46,173
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:05:46,341 --> 01:05:49,868
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:05:50,445 --> 01:05:52,572
I should say something to you here.

948
01:05:54,249 --> 01:05:55,807
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:05:55,984 --> 01:05:58,077
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:05:58,253 --> 01:06:00,221
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:06:03,124 --> 01:06:06,059
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:10,624
Where you going, man?

953
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,563
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,293
Oh, man.

955
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:24,542
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:06:24,712 --> 01:06:27,272
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:33,153
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:06:35,857 --> 01:06:39,987
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

959
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:46,665
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in</i>

960
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:50,430
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

961
01:06:50,605 --> 01:06:55,770
<i>I would understand</i>

962
01:06:55,944 --> 01:07:02,941
<i>I would understand</i>

963
01:07:03,284 --> 01:07:05,115
Um... Oh...

964
01:07:05,553 --> 01:07:06,679
What is it?

965
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:10,183
<i>The angry boy a bit too insane</i>

966
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:13,189
<i>Icing over a secret pain</i>

967
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:18,594
<i>You know you don't belong</i>

968
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:22,930
<i>Everyone I know has got a reason</i>

969
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:24,861
<i>To say</i>

970
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,529
<i>You can put the past away</i>

971
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:30,735
<i>I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

972
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:35,645
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in</i>

973
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:39,514
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

974
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:44,386
<i>I would understand</i>

975
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,392
<i>I would understand</i>

976
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:54,131
<i>I would understand</i>

977
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:58,295
<i>I would understand</i>

978
01:07:59,073 --> 01:08:01,473
<i>I would understand</i>

979
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:12,744
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:22,654
Carl.

981
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:25,657
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,926
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:31,868
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:36,340
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:41,337
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:44,610
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:47,254
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:49,356
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:53,085
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:08:53,261 --> 01:08:56,560
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

991
01:08:58,232 --> 01:09:00,826
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:09:01,002 --> 01:09:02,697
No.

993
01:09:14,315 --> 01:09:16,044
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:20,620
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

995
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:22,380
We've never done this before.

996
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:29,586
The next flight available for boarding...

997
01:09:30,164 --> 01:09:31,597
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:34,592
Okay.

999
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:35,793
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,130
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:38,465
Here we come.

1002
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,605
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:47,805
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:55,816
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,254
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds. "

1006
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:01,224
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,198
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:07,061
Check out the phone.

1009
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:10,762
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:10:10,938 --> 01:10:12,838
Hello?

1011
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:18,645
Nice shot.

1012
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:24,343
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:10:25,253 --> 01:10:27,153
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:10:28,856 --> 01:10:31,256
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:35,119
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:10:35,296 --> 01:10:36,320
Pull?

1017
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:40,258
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:43,336
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,277
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...</i>

1020
01:10:51,446 --> 01:10:55,712
<i>...for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.</i>

1021
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:05,726
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:08,453
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:11:08,629 --> 01:11:10,221
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:14,027
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,864
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:19,165
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:25,808
<i>The energy is palpable here,
Chris. I can't even hear myself think.</i>

1028
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:29,477
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:34,680
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:37,347
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:40,517
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:43,459
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:46,960
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:54,635
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1035
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:59,538
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:03,309
- Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,349
Don't, please.

1038
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:09,453
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:13,157
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:14,917
Come on.

1041
01:12:15,096 --> 01:12:18,964
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:20,828
Come on.

1043
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:25,865
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,770
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:32,742
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:12:39,253 --> 01:12:40,584
What?

1047
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,214
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:47,093
Really?

1049
01:12:47,261 --> 01:12:51,857
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:55,332
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:57,232
I love you like...

1052
01:12:57,738 --> 01:13:01,037
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:03,309
I've been thinking...

1054
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:05,968
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:13:06,147 --> 01:13:11,016
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:15,686
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

1057
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,817
What do you think?

1058
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:22,429
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:24,064
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:26,200
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,995
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,072
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:35,272
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:39,937
<i>Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...</i>

1065
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:58,358
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:04,000
I'll just be one minute.

1067
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:07,663
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:14:07,842 --> 01:14:09,673
I'm in.

1069
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:12,674
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:17,015
Sir?

1071
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:21,355
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:24,355
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:14:26,994 --> 01:14:29,724
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:32,695
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:35,028
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:14:35,202 --> 01:14:38,035
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:14:39,473 --> 01:14:41,805
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,568
Come on, lady.

1079
01:14:45,313 --> 01:14:48,578
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:52,913
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,055
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:57,213
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:14:57,391 --> 01:14:59,222
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,554
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:05,290
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:08,299
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1087
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:10,562
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,672
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,105
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:20,407
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder. Com?

1091
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:23,640
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:26,946
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:30,887
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1094
01:15:31,058 --> 01:15:33,583
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:35,251
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:15:35,429 --> 01:15:37,624
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:40,323
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:42,901
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:45,630
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:15:45,806 --> 01:15:47,933
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:15:48,943 --> 01:15:51,104
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:15:51,278 --> 01:15:53,906
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:15:54,081 --> 01:15:57,016
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:15:58,152 --> 01:16:02,179
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,356
His name was Marx.

1106
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:11,293
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:19,131
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:24,141
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,404
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,674
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,580
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1112
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:36,085
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:16:36,257 --> 01:16:38,157
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:16:38,325 --> 01:16:39,917
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:16:40,094 --> 01:16:43,154
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1116
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,299
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:16:49,103 --> 01:16:52,266
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,408
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:16:54,575 --> 01:16:57,442
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:16:57,978 --> 01:17:00,003
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:03,912
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:17:04,084 --> 01:17:05,813
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:17:05,986 --> 01:17:09,353
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:11,354
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:17:11,525 --> 01:17:13,516
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:16,128
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:18,925
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:21,431
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:22,796
You paused.

1130
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,632
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:29,936
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:34,274
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:43,184
Allison.

1134
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:46,359
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:04,169
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:06,537
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:09,911
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:12,075
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:18:12,253 --> 01:18:15,222
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:17,016
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:18:17,191 --> 01:18:21,059
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:23,196
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:25,832
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,561
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,204
...a. k.a. What normal people do.

1146
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:34,136
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:18:34,308 --> 01:18:35,434
Or not.

1148
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:37,509
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:18:37,678 --> 01:18:39,168
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,311
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:18:43,284 --> 01:18:44,683
Carl.

1152
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:50,023
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:18:50,824 --> 01:18:53,725
<i>- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.</i>

1154
01:18:53,894 --> 01:18:55,725
<i>- Do you?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1155
01:18:55,896 --> 01:18:57,830
<i>You know you and I are a lot alike?</i>

1156
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:01,398
<i>My mother likes good food.</i>

1157
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:04,897
<i>She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...</i>

1158
01:19:05,072 --> 01:19:07,006
<i>...than bad food any old day
of the week. "</i>

1159
01:19:07,174 --> 01:19:08,732
Hey.

1160
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:10,908
It's me again.

1161
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,546
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

1162
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:16,683
<i>The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...</i>

1163
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,398
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,932
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:41,997
Cool.

1166
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:45,469
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1167
01:19:48,716 --> 01:19:54,177
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:56,186
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:19:56,357 --> 01:19:59,485
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,323
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:17,071
Ah!

1172
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:35,922
Allison?

1173
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:40,226
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:20:40,401 --> 01:20:45,464
<i>- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.</i>

1175
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:47,470
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:50,041
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:53,941
<i>- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.</i>

1178
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:59,444
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,882
<i>Go get the ball!</i>

1180
01:21:01,055 --> 01:21:04,491
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1181
01:21:04,658 --> 01:21:08,560
...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,463
Which ones?

1183
01:21:12,132 --> 01:21:14,760
We are Sparta!

1184
01:21:18,505 --> 01:21:19,938
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:45,461
<i>You have three messages.</i>

1186
01:21:45,632 --> 01:21:48,362
<i>Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.</i>

1187
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:51,402
<i>No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.</i>

1188
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:54,632
<i>I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.</i>

1189
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,840
<i>Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.</i>

1190
01:21:58,011 --> 01:22:00,571
<i>You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.</i>

1191
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:03,512
<i>I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.</i>

1192
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:08,053
<i>And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.</i>

1193
01:22:08,655 --> 01:22:11,681
<i>It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...</i>

1194
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:15,625
<i>...but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.</i>

1195
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:18,924
<i>Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.</i>

1196
01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:21,761
<i>- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.</i>

1197
01:22:21,935 --> 01:22:23,903
<i>Right? Call me.</i>

1198
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,440
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:40,178
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:22:40,354 --> 01:22:41,616
What?

1201
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:44,451
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1202
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:51,960
Surprise!

1203
01:22:52,132 --> 01:22:54,726
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,369
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:59,199
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,238
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:03,842
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:06,104
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,441
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:11,749
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:14,410
On him, on him.

1212
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:18,448
Cake?

1213
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:19,649
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:24,230
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:23:25,799 --> 01:23:28,791
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:23:35,242 --> 01:23:39,235
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:23:39,413 --> 01:23:42,246
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,283
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:48,285
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:49,815
Oh.

1221
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:58,665
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:04,903
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:06,096
Do you dance?

1224
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:09,164
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,904
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:44,804
<i>- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...</i>

1227
01:24:49,116 --> 01:24:50,981
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:54,884
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:24:55,055 --> 01:24:57,023
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,284
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,985
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:07,224
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:08,993
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:11,729
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:16,205
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,505
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:21,671
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:25:21,848 --> 01:25:24,476
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:28,149
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:25:28,322 --> 01:25:30,790
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,926
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:40,298
Hi there.

1243
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:42,861
Hello there.

1244
01:25:43,637 --> 01:25:46,606
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:25:47,641 --> 01:25:52,635
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:25:56,149 --> 01:26:02,247
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:26:03,657 --> 01:26:05,386
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:26:15,235 --> 01:26:17,795
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:26:18,438 --> 01:26:24,308
<i>- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?</i>

1250
01:26:24,478 --> 01:26:27,345
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:26:27,514 --> 01:26:31,382
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:33,280
I don't know.

1253
01:26:34,187 --> 01:26:38,180
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:26:39,526 --> 01:26:41,994
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:26:42,162 --> 01:26:46,428
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,934
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:26:51,104 --> 01:26:57,373
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...</i>

1258
01:26:57,544 --> 01:27:00,513
<i>- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...</i>

1259
01:27:05,352 --> 01:27:07,081
Steph...

1260
01:27:07,754 --> 01:27:09,585
...I can't.

1261
01:27:10,223 --> 01:27:11,918
I'm sorry.

1262
01:27:14,428 --> 01:27:16,362
What are you saying?

1263
01:27:17,998 --> 01:27:20,193
I'm saying no.

1264
01:27:36,683 --> 01:27:38,150
Are you serious?

1265
01:27:52,532 --> 01:27:53,692
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:03,699
Oh, please.

1267
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:07,840
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:12,075
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:16,086
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:28:16,256 --> 01:28:20,454
<i>- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!</i>

1271
01:28:22,696 --> 01:28:24,823
Jackoff.

1272
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:31,428
<i>Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes. "</i>

1273
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:34,233
<i>Guess, mess.</i>

1274
01:28:34,407 --> 01:28:40,437
<i>Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.</i>

1275
01:28:40,614 --> 01:28:42,582
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,004
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:29:11,411 --> 01:29:15,108
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman. "

1278
01:29:15,282 --> 01:29:18,843
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:21,053
Peter.

1280
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:23,449
A covenant.

1281
01:29:23,623 --> 01:29:25,921
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:29,495
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:29:30,363 --> 01:29:33,196
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:29:33,366 --> 01:29:34,833
It is nonsense.

1285
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,162
It's him.

1286
01:29:39,706 --> 01:29:43,972
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:46,942
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1288
01:29:47,113 --> 01:29:49,547
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:53,550
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:29:54,588 --> 01:29:56,818
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:29:56,990 --> 01:30:00,653
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:30:00,827 --> 01:30:03,796
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:30:03,964 --> 01:30:06,057
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1294
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:09,134
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:30:09,302 --> 01:30:11,270
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:15,238
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:30:15,408 --> 01:30:17,035
...to get you started.

1298
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:19,838
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:30:20,013 --> 01:30:22,447
...not because a covenant tells you to...

1300
01:30:22,616 --> 01:30:25,551
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1301
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,481
Yeah.

1302
01:30:29,055 --> 01:30:30,784
You're right.

1303
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:34,425
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:30:34,594 --> 01:30:35,993
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:30:36,162 --> 01:30:38,722
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:43,393
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1307
01:30:44,204 --> 01:30:48,072
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:49,503
Perfect.

1309
01:30:52,312 --> 01:30:54,075
I said that.

1310
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:55,908
Whatever.

1311
01:30:57,751 --> 01:31:01,312
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:31:05,592 --> 01:31:08,060
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:31:08,228 --> 01:31:10,560
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:17,092
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:21,639
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:31:21,808 --> 01:31:26,245
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,007
Ducati.

1318
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:37,389
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1319
01:31:37,557 --> 01:31:40,754
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:43,259
No, Carl,
this is not the same.

1321
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:46,422
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:31:47,434 --> 01:31:49,402
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:50,831
- Torque.

1324
01:32:03,249 --> 01:32:05,308
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:32:07,187 --> 01:32:08,415
Ah!

1326
01:32:08,922 --> 01:32:10,753
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:32:22,035 --> 01:32:24,435
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:32:27,507 --> 01:32:28,565
Ah!

1329
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:33,844
Whoa!

1330
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,054
What an asshole.

1331
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:37,834
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:33:38,011 --> 01:33:41,913
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:33:42,081 --> 01:33:45,175
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:47,842
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:33:51,391 --> 01:33:52,483
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:54,854
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:33:55,028 --> 01:33:57,588
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:33:57,764 --> 01:34:00,096
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:02,860
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

1340
01:34:03,036 --> 01:34:06,995
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:34:07,173 --> 01:34:10,142
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,835
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:34:13,012 --> 01:34:15,003
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:34:15,181 --> 01:34:18,947
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:22,087
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:34:22,255 --> 01:34:25,349
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:28,551
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:34:28,728 --> 01:34:31,060
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:34:31,598 --> 01:34:34,066
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:34:34,234 --> 01:34:37,499
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:34:38,838 --> 01:34:40,965
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:43,165
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:34:43,776 --> 01:34:46,244
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:34:46,412 --> 01:34:49,745
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:52,976
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:34:53,152 --> 01:34:55,086
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:34:55,255 --> 01:34:57,917
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:34:58,091 --> 01:35:01,254
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:35:01,861 --> 01:35:03,852
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,089
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:35:08,034 --> 01:35:10,025
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,137
So just say yes...

1363
01:35:12,672 --> 01:35:15,106
...but only if you really want to.

1364
01:35:15,341 --> 01:35:18,469
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:21,610
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:35:22,148 --> 01:35:23,513
Well?

1367
01:35:30,323 --> 01:35:32,553
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:35:33,426 --> 01:35:37,021
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:35:44,003 --> 01:35:45,664
I like maybe.

1370
01:35:45,838 --> 01:35:47,032
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:36:13,967 --> 01:36:17,425
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:36:17,604 --> 01:36:19,765
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:21,873
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,943
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,706
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1376
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:31,441
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:36:31,618 --> 01:36:32,983
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:36:33,152 --> 01:36:37,680
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:36:39,158 --> 01:36:44,494
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:36:44,664 --> 01:36:49,101
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

1381
01:36:49,268 --> 01:36:51,600
Yes!

1382
01:36:57,076 --> 01:36:59,237
Good God.

1383
01:38:33,339 --> 01:38:35,466
So anything else
we need to know?

1384
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:39,907
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:41,637
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:38:41,814 --> 01:38:43,179
Right.

1387
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:45,781
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:38:45,952 --> 01:38:48,648
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

1389
01:38:50,356 --> 01:38:53,883
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,084
What?

1391
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:58,196
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:00,025
What if I'm
one of those chickens...

1393
01:39:00,199 --> 01:39:03,498
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:39:03,669 --> 01:39:06,604
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:10,332
I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,738
Hiyah!

1397
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:00,115
I love this.
